Code Overview:
This project uses a Kubernetes cluster to launch a containerized Node.js microservice.  In this task, the deployment is managed using Kubernetes, which guarantees the application's scalability, dependability, and automated management.  Important Kubernetes components are used, such as ReplicaSets, which keep the number of pod instances at the right level, Deployments, which allow for version control and controlled updates, and Pods, which house the application container.  YAML configuration files are used to deploy the Docker image after it has been extracted from Docker Hub.  The Kubernetes Dashboard is set up with secure token-based access through role binding and a dedicated service account to facilitate visual monitoring and control.  Kubectl is used to carry out every deployment step, and comprehensive instructions are given.
